This increase in the number results in increase in the size of the database required to store the documents of the customers.\nThe documents are generally in the image format uploaded by the customers themselves.\nThe raw format of the documents are typically of sizes of few MBs.\nStoring the raw format of the uploaded data in the database is an inefficient approach because it increases the POST and FETCH latency. It also increases the cost of maintaining the database.\nScaling is very inefficient if such inefficient storage methods are implemented."

In one of the iterations, the original image of an ID Card of size 1.5 MB was compressed to 45 KB without significant loss of resolution of text and image in the ID."

The generator tries to fool the discriminator, and the discriminator tries to keep from being fooled."
